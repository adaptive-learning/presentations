  % High-level motivation + context:
  \frametitle{Introductory Programming}

% - HoC = popular way to introduce children into programming,
%   used by millions of students every year
% - however, it is not personalized; it offers the same sequence of tasks to everybody
% - aim of the proposed research project: adaptive HoC -> more efficient and engaging learning

  \frametitle{Research Questions}
  % "expected contribution to AIED" = answering these RQs

  \emph{(in the context of introductory programming)}
  % I would like to address four high-level RQs:
  % // 4 high-level RQs, one concerning DM, PM, SM, and TM.
  \begin{enumerate}
  % [domain] How to organize tasks for a personalized Hour of Code activity?
  \item How to organize tasks for a personalized Hour of Code?
        % ~ what is a suitable domain model that would facilitate a personalized behavior?
        % // e.g., hierarchical linearly ordered PS (our hypothesis)

  % [performance] How to measure students' performance on programming tasks?
  \item How to measure performance on programming tasks?
    % Binary success not enough.
    % Other performance aspects: time, #edits, #executions, quality of program,
    % or even the full time series of created/executed programs.

  % [student] How to predict a future performance of a student on introductory programming tasks?
  \item How to predict future performance?
  % - ... leveraging programming concepts and considering integration skills
  % - Hypothesis: For use in outer loop (online), simple model enough (if good DM and PM).
  % - // more complex model such as LogisticHMM useful for offline analysis (setting parameters).

  % Answering RQ1-3, although important on their own, are mainly steps towards RQ4.
  % [tutor] How to recommend the next task to practice in Hour of Code activities?
  \item How to recommend the next task to practice?
  % - e.g., is mastery learning appropriate and how to adapt it to non-binary
  %   performance and specific domain model?
  % - How to introduce some safe randomization to collect diverse data useful for research
  %   while not harming the students?
  \end{enumerate}

  % - These are sort of "conventional questions" ("boring"?) but I argue, that
  %   they have not been answered sufficiently well for the context of intro
  %   programming, e.g., most research: binary performance; (only 2 problems, etc.)
  % - my goal: answer them such that the results can be applied, e.g., in Hour of Code, KA.

  \frametitle{Theoretical Framework}

  \begin{itemize}
  % As suggested by theories of flow and ZPC, to achieve efficient learning
  % and engagement, we need to provide student with an optimal challenge.
  \item state of flow, zone of proximal development
  % // + cognitive load theory, scaffolding

  % (NOTE: This is rather a "technical framework".)
  % But that is a difficult problem, so it is useful to decompose it into
  % several parts, e.g:
  \item models: domain, performance, student, tutor

  % These models can then be adapted to the students.
  % Adaptivity at different time scales:
  % - outer loop -- adapt to a particular student by an action (rcm) after each task
  % - design loop -- improve the whole system (adapting to a population)
  \item adaptivity: outer loop (mastery learning), design loop % (human-in-the-loop)
  \end{itemize}

  % Just an illustration of an example of the models currently used in RoboMission.
  % TODO(maybe): Maybe remove if there is not enough time / simplify the diagram.

  \frametitle{Methods}

  \begin{itemize}
    % - In our lab, we develop two systems for teaching introductory programming,
    % - several programming exercises with tens of problems, which provides
    % me with a plenty of diverse data for exploratory analysis.
    % Multiple exercises: important for generalizability of results.
  \item exploratory analysis, multiple exercises
    \begin{itemize}
    \item robot on grid, turtle graphics, numbers/text processing
    \item interface: Blockly x Python
    \end{itemize}
    % The exploratory analysis is not purely observational, because
    % we can also change the system (e.g. domain model) and evaluate
    % the intervention (design loop).

  \item online experiments to compare tutor models
    % "quasi-experiment?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item proxy for learning: performance on \emph{control tasks}
    \item chosen randomly after each problem set
      % Point for discussion: from which subset?
    \end{itemize}

  \item simulated experiments to explore methodological issues
    % - biases: (mastery) attrition, self-selection, learning, adaptive rcm, ...
    % - to understand how can the biases influence the observed data and results
  \end{itemize}
